### About

**rsbash** - run bash commands from rust.

Our macros **rash!** and **rashf!** allow you to call out to a bash shell, just as you would typically from a terminal. Since this is accomplished by interacting with libc, these macros can only be used on unix-like platforms (Linux, macOS etc).
